                <p className = "text-white text-lg mb-4">While trying out different things since 2021, I realized that I love
                building things and figuring out ways to convert an idea into applications. 
                With this principle, I tried out different things from web and iOS applications to AI and cloud technolgies.
                As a developer, I try to create projects that can not only be useful to others but also helping solve real-world problems and learning new technologies constantly.

                If i'm not working on projects, I hang out with friends, watch tv-shows and movies, listen to music, and even started reading books. I'm currently reading "Rich Dad Poor Dad" by Robert Kiyosaki.
